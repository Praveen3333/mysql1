    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "Ans.### What is a Database?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **database** is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. Databases are designed to manage and store large amounts of information efficiently, allowing users to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data. They are crucial for applications that need to manage structured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differentiation Between SQL and NoSQL Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL Databases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structure:**\n",
    "   - SQL databases are relational databases. They store data in tables, which consist of rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents an attribute of the record.\n",
    "   - They use a predefined schema to define the structure of the data. This schema must be adhered to strictly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Query Language:**\n",
    "   - SQL databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data. SQL is a standardized language that allows for complex queries and transactions.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Examples:**\n",
    "   - MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Transactions:**\n",
    "   - SQL databases support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, ensuring reliable and secure transaction processing.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Scalability:**\n",
    "   - Generally, SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning you can increase the capacity of a single server by adding more resources (CPU, RAM, storage).\n",
    "\n",
    "**NoSQL Databases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structure:**\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases are non-relational and can store data in various formats: document-oriented, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, or graph-based.\n",
    "   - They are schema-less or have a flexible schema, allowing for more adaptable data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Query Language:**\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases use different query languages depending on the type. For example, MongoDB uses a JSON-like query language, while Cassandra uses CQL (Cassandra Query Language).\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Examples:**\n",
    "   - MongoDB (document-oriented), Redis (key-value store), Cassandra (wide-column store), Neo4j (graph database).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Transactions:**\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases often sacrifice ACID properties for performance and scalability, although some NoSQL databases provide mechanisms for transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scalability:**\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases are generally horizontally scalable, meaning you can add more servers to distribute the load and increase capacity.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**DDL (Data Definition Language)** is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define, modify, and manage the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, schemas, and constraints.

    "\n",
    "### 1. CREATE\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CREATE` statement is used to create new database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and schemas. It defines the structure and schema of the object being created.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. DROP\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DROP` statement is used to delete existing database objects like tables, indexes, or databases. This operation is irreversible, and all data within the dropped object is permanently lost.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "Ans.### Primary Key\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Primary Key** is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. Primary keys are essential for ensuring the uniqueness of records and for establishing relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics of a Primary Key:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Uniqueness:** Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique across all rows in the table.\n",
    "2. **Non-null:** Primary key columns cannot contain NULL values. Every row must have a value for the primary key.\n",
    "3. **Immutability:** The values of primary key columns should not change frequently, as they uniquely identify rows.\n",
    "4. **Single Column or Composite Key:** A primary key can be a single column or a combination of multiple columns (composite key).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Defining a Primary Key**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",

    "### Foreign Key\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Foreign Key** is a column or a set of columns in a database table that establishes a link between the data in two tables. It is a reference to the primary key in another table and is used to enforce referential integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics of a Foreign Key:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Referential Integrity:** A foreign key ensures that the value in the foreign key column(s) must match a value in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table or be null.\n",
    "2. **Relationships:** Foreign keys establish relationships between tables, enabling relational databases to link records and enforce data integrity across tables.\n",
    "3. **Cascading Actions:** Foreign keys can define actions such as `ON DELETE CASCADE` or `ON UPDATE CASCADE` to automatically handle changes in the referenced primary key.\n",

    "Ans.### Connecting MySQL to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect MySQL to Python, you typically use a library such as `mysql-connector-python` or `PyMySQL`. Here, I'll use `mysql-connector-python` as an example.\n",

    "5. **Fetch and manipulate data as required**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to install the MySQL connector module. You can do this using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install mysql-connector-python\n",

    "\n",
    "### Example Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example code to connect to a MySQL database, create a cursor, and execute a simple query.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",

    "# Establishing a connection to the MySQL database\n",

    "#### execute()\n",
    "\n",
    "The `execute()` method is used to execute a single SQL query. The query can be any valid SQL statement, such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.\n",

For other types of SQL statements (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`), the changes are applied to the database, and you may need to commit the transaction using `connection.commit()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fetching Results\n",
